00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.931
with the help of which you can add subtitle to your YouTube videos

00:00:05.931 --> 00:00:13.800
automatically, that too in any language, for free, within a minute without the help of any 3rd party tool.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800
How? Thats what I am going to tell you in this video.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.193
But watch the whole video because it is going to be a goldmine.

00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:19.147
Well, shall we start?

00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:21.147
What's up guys, my name is Anirban, welcome to Teaching Monk

00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:24.243
without further adieu let me take you to my computer and show you how it is done.

00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:28.758
The first thing we are going to do is open a browser, which ever is your favorite browser.

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:31.360
Then will go to studio.youtube.com

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.360
By the way the method I am going to show you, with the help of which you can add subtitle in any language, without any third party tool,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.920
you will be able to do that from within YouTube studio, you will not have to go to any third party tool.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:52.670
Let's now visit studio.youtube.com The first thing you have to do is to go to "Content"

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.116
whichever video you want to add the subtitle to, for eg let's take this one.

00:00:57.116 --> 00:01:02.703
To add it what do you do typically? You go to subtitle here right? You don't have to go here

00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:04.703
You have to go to this subtitle.

00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:12.192
Go to this subtitle. After clicking this subtitle you will notice you have a "Hindi language automatic"

00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:18.486
In such a situation if you click the "Add Language" button, you will see many language.

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:25.704
Means any language, if you want to add in Punjabi, or in Bengali, or in Hindi, or in Arabic, or in Chinese, you can add them all.

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:33.465
But there is a problem and the problem is.. For eg here let us try to add Punjabi.

00:01:33.465 --> 00:01:42.204
As soon as we try to add Punjabi, then say "Add". After clicking add this window that opens up, note that the "Auto translate" is greyed out

00:01:42.204 --> 00:01:47.000
that means we cannot click it. But there is a way to switch it on.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.333
Guys I got this accidentally, I didn't learn it anywhere I got this accidentally. So I thought I would share this with you guys.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:02:01.957
There is a way to switch it on. And if we can somehow switch it on, then all our subtitles will become automatic. In any language, without any 3rd Party tool.

00:02:01.957 --> 00:02:08.626
Now let's cross this first. First of all we will have to understand "why is it not allowing us to add in Punjabi?".

00:02:08.626 --> 00:02:19.478
It is not allowing us to add it because in order to add it, YouTube wants us to have a base subtitle. Base subtitle means a subtitle based on which it will translate it to other languages.

00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:24.703
That is a base subtitle. And that base subtitle cannot be automatic. That should be written by you.

00:02:24.703 --> 00:02:32.418
Here we have Hindi, but that is automatic and it does not want automatic. But what we want is to make a duplicate of this Hindi subtitle, which

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:35.339
YouTube doesn't consider as automatic

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.484
To do that is very simple. Let's click "Duplicate".

00:02:38.484 --> 00:02:46.311
Here you can see we have Hindi subtitle. You may want to read and make any changes if you want, then click "Publish"

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:54.088
What really happened by clicking publish, is that we now have another Hindi subtitle. But it is not automatic. This will play the role of a base subtitle.

00:02:54.088 --> 00:02:59.798
It will play the role of a base subtitle, it will not be treated as automatic. I mean in the eyes of YouTube Studio.

00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:07.351
Now if you want you can add in Punjabi. Now when you try to add in Punjabi, you will notice the "Auto translate" is available.

00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:16.697
Now all you have to do is to click this button, and notice that the whole thing has come block by block in written in Punjabi in 1 minute, not even a minute, in just 15 sec.

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:22.071
Now just publish this. As soon as you publish it your Punjabi subtitle is ready.

00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:28.740
Now if you want add Hindi, or Kanada or Malayalam or Gujrati or Bengali or any other language you want

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.168
With in 5 minutes you can add 10 languages. 10 or even 15 languages.

00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:39.480
You didn't need any third party tool, you didn't have to pay anyone, you needed nothing else, you got it done here itself.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.630
So guys when I was making this video I searched the internet to find if anyone else has shown this method.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.058
Honestly guys I didn't find anyone else showing this method, so this method has appeared on this video for the first time.

00:03:49.058 --> 00:03:52.801
For that this video deserves a like, share and comment. And please don't leave without subscribing.

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:57.117
So that you guys get similar videos. The video is not over yet, I have to play it for you first.

00:03:57.117 --> 00:04:02.280
After adding this Punjabi subtitle, let's come back a step,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.505
then click this video, then by clicking this let us play this.

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:14.025
After switching on the video you can notice the Hindi subtitle is of course coming, but if we click the cog-wheel

00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:16.025
and go to subtitles and notice that the Punjabi subtitle has also come.

00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:21.063
And believe me you can add Bengali, Gujrati and others.

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:24.121
Now choose Punjabi, notice that Punjabi subtitles are showing up. Now let me play this

00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:25.503
[video plays]

00:04:25.503 --> 00:04:27.503
Now see Punjabi is showing up.

00:04:27.503 --> 00:04:37.696
This is how you can add subtitles very easily, automatic, in any language, for free without any 3rd party tool

00:04:37.696 --> 00:04:45.120
