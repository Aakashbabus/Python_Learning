Step1 : Download VS Code for mac from this link https://code.visualstudio.com
Step2 : move the download file directly to Applications folder and its ready to use
Step3 : Create a folder on the desktop and open the Folder from VS Code 
Step4 : create a Test.py file in the main folder and create Hello world program 
Step5 : In the terminal of VS Code / from the OS Terminal navigate to the folder on desktop and setup virtual environment 
        pip3 install virtualenv
        virtualenv env
        source env/bin/activate
        python3 Test.py 
        deactivate 


Virtual Envirnment is created inside of the VS Code and you can install packages like python , etc inside of this environment 
and this works independently 
Make sure python interpiter is configured correctely or else you will have to give full path to run the python scripts like /usr/bin/python3
