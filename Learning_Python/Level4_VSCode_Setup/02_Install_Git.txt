How to push the local changes to the github cloud repository 
    git init 
    git remote set-url origin  https://github.com/Aakashbabus/Python_Learning.git
    git status
    git add .                       for adding all files 
    git add index.html              for adding specific files 
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    git push -u origin main 
    enter username 
    enter SSH key ( find it in settings , developer settings )

How to compare the changes between github and local repository and pull changes from there 
    git remote -v
    git fetct origin
    git diff main origin/main  ( if you get in to the file then press ESC and then type :wq)
    git pull origin master

How to branch out , delete main and make branch as new main 

    If you want to delete all your commit history but keep the code in its current state, it is very safe to do it as in the following:
    Checkout/create orphan branch (this branch won't show in git branch command):
    git checkout --orphan latest_branch
    Add all the files to the newly created branch:
    -- git add -A
    Commit the changes:
    -- git commit -am "commit message"
    Delete main (default) branch (this step is permanent):
    -- git branch -D main
    Rename the current branch to main:
    -- git branch -m main
    Finally, all changes are completed on your local repository, and force update your remote repository:
    -- git push -f origin main
    PS: This will not keep your old commit history around. Now you should only see your new commit in the history of your git repository.
